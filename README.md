# 🧟 Welcome to the LM-BS Repo

This repository is used to discuss future changes to LevelledMobs (`lokka30/LevelledMobs`). Feel free to partake in any discussions.

This repository is particularly used to refine the configuration system to be used in LM4 (LevelledMobs 4).

## ✍️ LM4 Config Brainstorming

> **Note:**
>
> - Remember to select a branch to view a particular brainstormed system!
>
> - Do not merge any brainstorming branches into `master`.

The following branches are used for brainstorming:

- `bs0`: *Listeners System*
- `bs1`: *First iteration of the Functions System*
- `bs2`: *Second iteration of the Functions System*

Configuration brainstorms use the following file structure:

- `demo/`: some files that just use a bunch of random functionality clumped together for showcase purposes.
- `real/`: files that are more 'presentable' i.e. they would be used (in a final revision of such) as the actual files generated by default for users.
- `README.md`: describes info about the particular branch.
