## LM4 Config Brainstorming File System

- `demo/`: some files that just use a bunch of random functionality clumped together for showcase purposes.
- `real/`: files that are more 'presentable' i.e. they would be used (in a final revision of such) as the actual files generated by default for users.
- `README.md`: describes info about the particular branch.
