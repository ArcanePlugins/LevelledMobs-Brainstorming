# Settings and Rules
* No more `rules.yml`, as the rules system has been moved to `settings.yml`.
* Most settings have been moved to `advanced.yml` - they were all advanced settings anyways.
* The Rules system is now based upon a concept called `listener functions`, giving you an enormous amount of control through the configuration.
* Presets have been moved into `presets.yml`.
* Groups have been moved into `groups.yml` and are no longer limited to either biomes and mobs.

# Levels
* Level 1 mobs receive stats, instead of being forced to have default stats.
* There is no "minimum level". Even negative levels are possible.
