  #### Buffed Drops Hard Nerf Settings
  # Should certain types of levelled mobs have any
  # buffed item or experience drops? Enabling this will
  # likely have adverse effects on your server's economy.

    # Mobs that are bosses, such as Ender Dragons, Withers, etc.

  #### Update Checker Settings
  # The update checker should only be disabled if it is
  # causing any errors on your server.
  # Keep LevelledMobs up-to-date.

  #### Debugging System Settings
  # The debugging system is used by maintainers, developers
  # and testers to check if things are working correctly
  # behind the scenes. It sends 'useful spam' to your console
  # logs which you need to sift through to find what you're
  # looking for. You should not have any debugging enabled
  # unless you are actively using the debug output.
  # You can quickly enable all debugging by using...
  #   not-in-list: []
  # ...which will enable ALL debug categories.
  #### THIS SETTING IS HIDDEN BY DEFAULT

  #### Integration Settings
  # Configure some aspects about LevelledMobs' integrations
  # here. Integrations are cooperation layers between
  # LevelledMobs and another plugin.

  #### Minimum Level Limiter
  # A hard limiter on what the minimum possible level is
  # in LevelledMobs. Has priority over everything, even
  # summon overrides. Negative values are hard-coded to
  # not be possible as we are unsure of what damage it
  # could cause to a server if someone decided to try it.
  #### THIS SETTING IS HIDDEN BY DEFAULT
  minimum-level: 1

  #### Minimum Buff Multiplier Limiter
  # A hard limiter on what the minimum possible buff
  # multiplier is in LevelledMobs. Negative values are
  # hard-coded to not be possible as we are unsure of
  # what damage it could cause to a server if someone
  # decided to try it.
  #### THIS SETTING IS HIDDEN BY DEFAULT
  minimum-buff-multiplier: 0.5

  # Status: DONE
  #### Circular Dependency Detection in Functions
  # This toggles whether LevelledMobs will detect if
  # a Function is calling another function which then
  # calls the original function, resulting in a circular
  # dependency, which will likely cause a stack overflow.
  #
  # In some cases this circular dependency is intentional
  # as eventually a condition is satisfied which could end
  # the loop - in those cases, the user can be advised to
  # disable this detection.
  #
  # If a circular function dependency is detected then LM
  # will simply run the 'exit-function' action inside the
  # function that it is detected in.
  #### THIS SETTING IS HIDDEN BY DEFAULT
  circular-function-dependency-detection: true
