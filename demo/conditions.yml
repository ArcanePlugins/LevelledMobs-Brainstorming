# TODO:
# - elaborate on how LM can source a world's spawnpoint
#   from multiple plugins as integrations, e.g. Essentials,
#   PhantomWorlds, and also Bukkit as a default. "SpawnpointProvider"
#   Unsure about Multiverse, probably overkill considering it is quite dead
#   and including it would fatten the binary size.

# Conditions *intentionally* not present from LM3:
# - apply-above-y and apply-below-y
#   Use a 'custom' condition instead to work with
#   any coordinate values.

# Here is a list of all of the conditions!
conditions:

  generic:
    # Status: DONE
    # Check if a mob has a certain entity type
    # E.g. this checks if a mob is either a creeper or ender dragon
    - check: 'mob-type'
      in-list: ['CREEPER', 'ENDER_DRAGON']

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Check if a mob has spawned for a certain reason
    # E.g. this checks if the mob was spawned from a spawner, or spawned naturally
    - check: 'mob-spawn-reason'
      in-list: ['SPAWNER', 'NATURAL']

    # Status: DONE
    # Check if the mob is currently in a certain world
    # Note: there is also 'player-world'
    - check: 'mob-world'
      in-list: ['world', 'world_the_end', 'world_nether', 'spawn']

    # Status: DONE
    # Self explanatory
    # Note: there is also 'player-biome'
    - check: 'mob-biome'
      in-list: ['JUNGLE']

    # Status: DONE
    # Chance out of 100 that this condition will return 'true'.
    - check: 'chance'
      value: 100

    # Status: DONE
    # Check if the mob's nametag contains any of the entries
    # Note: This is NOT the LevelledMobs nametag! This is
    # checking the *actual* nametag of the mob, i.e. ones
    # named using a nametag item or edited by a plugin.
    #
    # You can use '*' to check if the mob has any nametag at all.
    #
    # Note: there is also 'player-name-contains' and also
    # a variant that checks for exact matches instead of contains,
    # also for mobs and players respectively.
    - check: 'mob-customname-contains'
      in-list: ['jeff', 'mary', 'Sam']

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Check if the mob is a certain distance away from the
    # spawnpoint of the world it is in
    # Equivalent condition exists for players as well
    - check: 'mob-distance-from-spawn'
      value: '0-100'

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Check if the mob is tamed
    - check: 'mob-tamed'
      state: 'TAMED' # TAMED, NOT_TAMED.

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Checks if a mob has a certain scoreboard tag
    # If 'not-in-list' is used, it inverts the condition
    - check: 'mob-scoreboard-tags'
      in-list: ['scoreboard-tag-example']

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Checks if the mob's world's time in ticks is between two values
    # Equivalent condition exists for players as well
    - check: 'mob-world-time-ticks'
      value: '0-24000'

  integrations:

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Check if a certain mob is already 'owned' by another plugin.
    # For example, this checks if a mob is owned by EliteMobs.
    - check: 'mob-owner'
      in-list: ['ELITE_MOBS']

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Check if the mob is currently in a WorldGuard region.
    # Note: there is also player-worldguard-region.
    # E.g. this checks if a mob is not in the 'spawn' region.
    - check: 'mob-worldguard-region'
      not-in-list: ['spawn']

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Checks if a mob's MythicMobs name is in a list.
    - check: 'mob-mythicmobs-name'
      in-list: ['SKELETON_KING']

  levelling:

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Allows checking if a mob is levelled or not.
    # Can also check if it has a certain value.
    - check: 'mob-level'

      # Status: NOT DONE
      # 'LEVELLED': the mob must be levelled
      # 'NOT_LEVELLED': the mob must not be levelled
      # 'EITHER': the mob can be levelled or not levelled
      state: 'LEVELLED'

      # Status: NOT DONE
      # Check if a mob's level is between two values.
      #
      # If this check runs on a mob that has no level, it
      # returns 'false'.
      value: '0-100'

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Check if a mob was spawned by a LevelledMobs Mob Spawner
    # which has a certain name.
    - check: 'mob-spawner-name'
      in-list: ['cool-zombie-spawner', 'Penals-Spawner']

  player:

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Check if a player has a certain list of permissions
    - check: 'player-permission'
      value: ['essentials.help']
  
  advanced:

    # Status: NOT DONE
    # Custom checks allow you to use various placeholders
    # to achieve more fine grained things.
    # This uses the Crunch library to evaluate boolean
    # expressions.
    # This example checks if the mob's X coordinate is
    # greater than 2,950.
    - check: 'custom'
      formula: '%mob-coordinate-x% > 2950'
