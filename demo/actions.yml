  functions:

    # Tells LM to immediately stop running a function
    # Note: will only stop the current function - e.g.
    # if Function1 calls Function2 and Function2 wants
    # to run 'exit-function' then Function1 will still
    # run after Function2 is done.
    # See 'exit-all' if you want it to also cancel
    # Function1.

    # function, regardless if this is called in an

    # three functions will immediately stop.
