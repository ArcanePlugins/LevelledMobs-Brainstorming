# Welcome to the presets file! Here you can reduce the amount of boilerplate
# you need to write in the functions system as presets essentially act as
# 'copy and paste' bits for your functions. It can also be used to tidy up
# some large ugly parts from your functions configuration so that your
# settings file is easier to edit and understand. Define as many presets
# as you need to.
