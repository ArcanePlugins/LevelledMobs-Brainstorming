#### Advanced Settings File
# It is *highly* recommended that you do not
# edit any of the settings in this file,
# unless a LevelledMobs maintainer has suggested
# you do so, or if you are certain you know
# what you are doing. All of these settings
# will have adverse effects on your server if
# adjusted improperly. Therefore, you should
# leave this file alone - or, if a setting here
# interests you, you should ask LevelledMobs
# maintainers if it is safe to do so.
#### [advanced.yml]

#### Buffed Drops Hard Nerf Settings
# Should certain types of levelled mobs have any
# buffed item or experience drops? Enabling this will
# likely have adverse effects on your server's economy.
buffed-drops-for:

  # Mobs spawned from Monster Spawner blocks.
  spawner-mobs: false

  # Mobs that are bosses, such as Ender Dragons, Withers, etc.
  boss-mobs: false

#### Update Checker Settings
# The update checker should only be disabled if it is
# causing any errors on your server.
# Keep LevelledMobs up-to-date.
update-checker:
  enabled: true
  notify:
    players-with-permission: true
    console-log: true

#### Debugging System Settings
# The debugging system is used by maintainers, developers
# and testers to check if things are working correctly
# behind the scenes. It sends 'useful spam' to your console
# logs which you need to sift through to find what you're
# looking for. You should not have any debugging enabled
# unless you are actively using the debug output.
# You can quickly enable all debugging by using...
#   not-in-list: []
# ...which will enable ALL debug categories.

# LevelledMobs and another plugin.

#### Minimum Level Limiter
# A hard limiter on what the minimum possible level is
# in LevelledMobs. Has priority over everything, even
# summon overrides. Negative values are hard-coded to
# not be possible as we are unsure of what damage it
# could cause to a server if someone decided to try it.
minimum-level: 1

#### Minimum Buff Multiplier Limiter
# A hard limiter on what the minimum possible buff
# multiplier is in LevelledMobs. Negative values are
# hard-coded to not be possible as we are unsure of
# what damage it could cause to a server if someone
# decided to try it.
minimum-buff-multiplier: 0.5
