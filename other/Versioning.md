# Differences with Semantic Versioning

In the `major.minor.patch` version format, SemVer increments the `major` version when a breaking API change has been made.

However, LM4 will use the `major` version instead as a 'revamp' version, i.e., how LM1-4 are majorly different from each other (internally and/or externally).
